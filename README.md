### 2. Title: Time series prediction of electricity demand and beyond: How recent machine learning technologies work
**Time: 14:20 ~ 15:10, June 10, 2022 (Offline)** <br/>
> * **Speaker: Prof. Kiyota Hashimoto (Prince of Songkla University, Thailand)** <br/>
> <img src="images\_kiyota.png" width="300" /> <br/>
> * Abstract: Electricity is one of the most important infrastructures for the current civilized life, and its importance has been becoming growing. Stable supply of electricity is indispensable but demand varies due to various regular and unexpected conditions. Many middle-developed and developing countries also need to strengthen and stabilize their electricity supply and for that, precise estimation of electricity demand is waited, for which recent machine learning technologies can help. In this talk, some essential ideas of time-series prediction are introduced, and then the concepts of several traditional and recent models of time-series prediction are discussed, followed by research results. Finally, future directions are shown based on the idea of the IoT(Internet of Things)-based society.

### 3. Smart Grid Security: A Machine Learning Perspective
**Time: 15:20 ~ 16:10, June 10, 2022 (Offline)** <br/>  
> * **Speaker: Prof. Paul Yoo (Birkbeck College, University of London, England)** <br/>
> <img src="images\yoo.png" width="300" /> <br/>
> * Abstract: This talk covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of securing smart grid using machine learning with particular focus on false data injection (FDI). FDI attacks are malicious insertions of false data as sensor measurements (targeting the interface rather than the computational/network components) in a cyber physical system, in order to lead the system to take a wrong action. Due to the rapid growth of the Internet and associated complex pervasive systems, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, other domains such as finance, healthcare, finance, manufacturing and defence have also been exploited with similar malicious actions and thus FDI has become one of the top-priority issues to deal with today. In this talk, we discuss the impact of FDI in critical domains like smart grid and its countermeasures, and introduce machine learning based methodologies on how to defend smart grid from such attacks.

### 4. Forecasting the remaining Life of the Lithium-ion Battery using Machine Learning
**Time: 16:20 ~ 17:10, June 10, 2022 (Online)** <br/>  
> * **Speaker: Prof. Debnath Bhattacharyya (K.L. University, India)** <br/>
> <img src="images\debnath.jpg" width="300" /> <br/>
> * Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries power mobile electronics, electric cars, and home storage. Even though batteries store energy better than most other methods, their lifespan must be predicted to ensure economic viability. Modern battery management systems predict a battery's RUL. This improves battery system performance (BMS). Business and academia want to know how long lithium-ion batteries last. This talk is on machine learning (ML) methods for predicting Lithium-ion battery RUL. This talk summarizes recently proposed RUL estimation methods for lithium-ion batteries. Second, accuracy and difficulty of a new evaluation method were compared. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) can learn and adapt to predict RUL. BMS and RUL prediction research problems and future directions are also discussed. Finally, how methods have changed over time is summarized.
